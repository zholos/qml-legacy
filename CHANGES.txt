  * Added 'mm' and 'ms' functions.

Version 0.3.2 on 2011-06-04:
  * When compiling with ATLAS, use the provided optimized LAPACK routines and
    parameters.

Version 0.3.1 on 2011-06-01:
  * Removed support for alternative build profiles and for compiling using
    Windows SDK.
  * Added option to compile with ATLAS instead of reference BLAS, improving
    LAPACK performance.

Version 0.2.1 on 2010-02-17:
  * Added 'root'/'rootx', 'solve'/'solvex', 'line'/'linex', 'min'/'minx' and
   'conmin'/'conminx' nonlinear optimization functions.

Version 0.1.8 on 2009-10-25:
  * Old 'mdiag' function renamed to 'diag', which creates a diagonal matrix.
    New 'mdiag' function added to extract the main diagonal from a matrix.
    The intended convention is that "m" functions operate on matrixes.
  * Added 'mqrp' and 'mrank' matrix functions.
  * Added 'bncdf', 'bnicdf', 'pscdf', 'psicdf', 'smcdf', 'smicdf', 'kcdf' and
   'kicdf' probability functions.

  * Preliminary support for OpenSolaris.

Version 0.1.4 on 2009-10-05:
  * Fixed thread safety, which is required for 'peach'.

Version 0.1.3 on 2009-10-01:
