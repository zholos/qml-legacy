Version 0.3.7 on 2011-07-04:
  * Fixed building of ATLAS on 64-bit Windows.
  * Prevented invalid read in CONMAX on NaN input.

Version 0.3.6 on 2011-06-30:
  * Fixed building of ATLAS on 64-bit Linux.

Version 0.3.5 on 2011-06-28:
  * Added 'mls'/'mlsx' and 'mlsq'/'mlsqx' functions.
  * A matrix of null values is now returned instead of an empty list in case of
    singular input to 'minv' and 'ms', non-positive-definite input to 'mchol',
    and computation failure in 'mev' and 'msvd'.

Version 0.3.4 on 2011-06-26:
  * The system libm is used instead of FDLIBM.
  * ATLAS is now the default and only option. CLAPACK is replaced with Fortran
    LAPACK. A Fortran compiler is required to build.
  * Two-argument scalar functions are now only threaded over a vector in the
    second argument, but not in the first, except 'atan2', 'pow', 'fmod',
    'hypot' and 'beta', which are threaded over both arguments. Three-argument
    functions are now threaded over a vector in the third argument.
  * Coefficients supplied to 'poly' must be either atoms or two-element vectors
    representing complex numbers. One-element vectors are not accepted.
  * Bytes (type "x") are no longer accepted for any numeric arguments.

Version 0.3.3 on 2011-06-13:
  * Added 'mm' and 'ms' functions.

Version 0.3.2 on 2011-06-04:
  * When compiling with ATLAS, use the provided optimized LAPACK routines and
    parameters.

Version 0.3.1 on 2011-06-01:
  * Removed support for alternative build profiles and for compiling using
    Windows SDK.
  * Added option to compile with ATLAS instead of reference BLAS, improving
    LAPACK performance.

Version 0.2.1 on 2010-02-17:
  * Added 'root'/'rootx', 'solve'/'solvex', 'line'/'linex', 'min'/'minx' and
   'conmin'/'conminx' nonlinear optimization functions.

Version 0.1.8 on 2009-10-25:
  * Old 'mdiag' function renamed to 'diag', which creates a diagonal matrix.
    New 'mdiag' function added to extract the main diagonal from a matrix.
    The intended convention is that "m" functions operate on matrixes.
  * Added 'mqrp' and 'mrank' matrix functions.
  * Added 'bncdf', 'bnicdf', 'pscdf', 'psicdf', 'smcdf', 'smicdf', 'kcdf' and
   'kicdf' probability functions.

Version 0.1.7 on 2009-10-13:
  * Support building with GCC 3 on Linux.
  * Support building on 64-bit OpenSolaris (x86).

Version 0.1.6 on 2009-10-12:
  * Fixed integer argument size in LAPACK calls on 64-bit Linux, OpenSolaris
    and Darwin.
  * Added 'mqr' and 'mlup' functions.

Version 0.1.5 on 2009-10-06:
  * Preliminary support for OpenSolaris.

Version 0.1.4 on 2009-10-05:
  * Fixed thread safety, which is required for 'peach'.

Version 0.1.3 on 2009-10-01:
  * When calling LAPACK, query and allocate optimal workspace.
  * Support Darwin.

Version 0.1.2 on 2009-09-25:
  * Support GCC on Windows.

Version 0.1.1 on 2009-09-10:
    First release.
